					These speakers seriously rocked on movies, and the performance on two-channel music was so intoxicating that sometimes I started to feel the speakers were tailor-made for whatever song I was listening to until the next song came on and then I thought the speakers were made just for that song. This is what you get with properly engineered speakers – you get performance that works for all sorts of material and users. It’s because these speakers pass the signal with the least interpretation or distortion on their part.
